# TV-Series API

This project made with swift creates an application capable to list any series from TVMaze. It can show
serie information such as episode photos, summary, seasons and so on.

## Installation

You can basically clone the project, open it, build and play with it!

## Tools

TV-Series API does the following things:
```
- List every series separated by 250 items per page
- Search for any serie by name query
- Show serie details like name, number of episodes, season and a list of it's episodes.
- Show episode details like summary, image, name.
```

## Thanks

A very welcome knowledge was conquered from this project building. Maybe soon it gets bigger.
